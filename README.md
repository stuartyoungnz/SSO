# SSO

This is my code to 
1. Process the all users spreadsheet and count by creation date, and count users who are still active. 
2. Cross-reference with other lists of email addresses to determine what use the accounts have been put to.
3. Compare with old versions of the all users spreadsheet to 
  a. see how the last login date / active users changes over time
  b. look for errors in the last login date

The actual spreadsheets are, of course, private, since they contain personally indentifiable information.
